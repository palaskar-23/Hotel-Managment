# Hotel-Managment
I have created a check-in form through which the hotel employees can check-in the guests that stay at the hotel.
Their bill is going to be calculated based on how many nights they stay.
 The guests can request additional services like car parking, in-house laundry and such and that too will be added to their bill.
 
 Also,
 The user will be prompted to enter the guest's name, number of days their staying, whether they're in a membership program, and if they'd like any additional services.
 All these charges will then be calculated using a formula and a total fee will be generated. 
The guest's details will also be saved into a spreadsheet for further access and record-keeping.
